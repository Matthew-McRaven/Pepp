/*!
 * \brief A symbol represents a named value or location in memory that may be
 * defined at most once.
 *
 * Symbols provided by this namespace are meant to be flexibile--supporting
 * microprogramming and ELF usage.
 *
 * Symbols that are undefined after linkage should cause an error; symbols
 * defined multiple times should cause immediate errors. Some examples of symbol
 * values are: currently undefined (symbol::empty), an address of a line of code
 * (symbol::value_location), or a numeric constant (symbol::value_const)
 *
 * As this class exposes all of its data publicly, it is up to the user to
 * ensure that properties such as binding and definition state are updated
 * correctly. This API decision was made because it is impossible for a symbol
 * to know if its value is being set because it is defined, or if the value is
 * being set to handle relocation. Simply put, the symbol doesn't know enough to
 * update these fields.
 *
 * Values have 64 bits, with a mandatory bitmask and length in the value.
