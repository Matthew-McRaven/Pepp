# Machine Language

Reference: _Computer Systems_, Chapters 3, 4.

A machine language program is a binary sequence, that is, a sequence of ones and zeros, that the machine interprets according to its von Neumann cycle as in Figure 4.32 of the text.
Therefore, to write a machine language program is to write a sequence of ones and zeros.
Fortunately, the Pep/9 loader permits you to use the hexadecimal abbreviation for binary, as Section 3.4 explains.
