# Endless loops

If you execute a program with an endless loop, you can interrupt it by pressing <command>+`.` on a Mac or <control>+`.` on a Windows computer.
Or, you can select Debug→Interrupt Execution from the menu.
Either of these actions will pause execution of the program, allow you to use the debugging tools, and, if you wish, continue execution of your program.

Alternatively, you can terminate execution of your program by selecting Debug→Stop Debugging from the menu or clicking the Stop icon in the tool bar.
