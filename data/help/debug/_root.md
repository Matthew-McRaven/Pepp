# Debugging Programs

The Pep/9 system provides debugging tools to help you locate errors in the programs you write.
The tools include the CPU display, a memory dump, tracing machine code, tracing assembler code, break points, and a symbolic trace feature.
If you are debugging a machine language program that you wrote you can use the memory dump feature but you cannot set break points or use the symbolic trace feature.
You can use all the debugging features if you are debugging an assembly language program.
An additional debugging tool is the byte converter, which is available any time the application is running.
