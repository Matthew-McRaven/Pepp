# File Extensions

The Pep/9 system uses the following file extensions:

* `.pep` is the file extension for source code programs.  
* `.pepo` is the file extension for object code programs.  
* `.pepl` is the file extension for the formatted program listing.

All these files are text files that you can modify with your favorite text editor or word processor outside the Pep/9 application.
When you open a `.pep` file, it opens in the Source Code pane.
When you open a `.pepo` file, it opens in the Object Code pane.
Although you can save a `.pepl` file, there is no facility for inputting it into the Pep/9 application.
