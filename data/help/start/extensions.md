# File Extensions

The Pepp system uses the following file extensions:

* `.pep` is the file extension for source code programs.  
* `.pepo` is the file extension for object code programs.  
* `.pepl` is the file extension for the formatted program listing.
* `.pepm` is the file extension for macros.

All these files are text files that you can modify with your favorite text editor or word processor outside the Pepp application.
Although you can save a `.pepl` file, there is no facility for inputting it into the Pep/9 application.

When you open a file, it will open a dialog similar to the **Welcome** screen to select the appropriate project type for that file.
