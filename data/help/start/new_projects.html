<h1>Creating a New Project</h1>
<p>
  Upon opening the application, you will be greeted with the
  <b>Welcome</b> screen, which will guide you through project creation. A
  <b>project</b> is a self-contained workspace that holds your source code and
  the tools needed to edit, simulate, and debug your program.
</p>
<p>
  You can create a new project from the <b>Welcome</b> mode by selecting a
  combination of textbook edition and level of abstraction. Each button opens a
  new project tab fresh editor and simulator environment tailored to your
  selection. You can switch between projects by switching tabs.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  You can have multiple projects open at once. Each is simulated, edited, and
  debugged independently. You can return to the <b>Welcome</b> screen at any
  time (see <a href="slug://start/modes">Switching Modes</a>) to start another
  project.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> After creating a project, you cannot change its type. To switch
  architectures or levels of abstraction, create a new project.
</p>

<h2>Choosing an Edition</h2>
<p>
  The edition selector at the top of the screen corresponds to editions of
  <i>Computer Systems</i>; you should choose the one matching your course
  materials. If you are an independent student, we recommend choosing the sixth
  edition.
</p>
<p>
  Only one edition can be active at a time. Selecting an edition updates the
  available project types listed inside of buttons below.
</p>

<h2>Selecting a Project Type</h2>
<p>
  Each button in the grid represents a specific architecture and level of
  abstraction. When you choose a project type, the new environment will contain
  the editors, instruction set, and debugger features appropriate for that
  configuration. For descriptions of the available features in each project
  type, see <a href="slug://flows">Common Workflows</a>.
</p>
<p>Some sample project types are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Pep/10, ISA3, Bare Metal</b> — For low-level object-code programming
    without an operating system. It features a hex editor for object code and
    streamlined debugging facilities for simple programs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Pep/10, Asmb5, Full OS</b> — For writing translations of C programs to
    assembly language or writing assembly programs with system calls. It
    features a source and listing pane, capable of
    <a href="slug://flows/step">advanced stepping modes</a> and simulating OS interactions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>RISC-V, Asmb3, Bare Metal</b> — For writing assembly language in the
    RISC-V instruction set without operating system support.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Other Ways to Create a Project</h1>
<p>You can also start a new project by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Selecting <b>File → New</b> (empty project).</li>
  <li>
    Opening a file with <b>File → Open</b> (project loads with the file’s
    content).
  </li>
  <li>
    Copying an example from the help system (project loads with the example’s
    code).
  </li>
</ul>
