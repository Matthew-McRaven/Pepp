        Pep/10 supports multiple levels of abstraction described in the
        <a href="#">Computer Systems textbook</a>, each providing a different
        view of the computing process. Each level uses different workflows and
        user interface elements for writing and debugging programs.
      </p>

      <h2>Supported Levels</h2>
      <p>
        While <i>Computer Systems</i>, 6th edition describes seven levels of
        abstraction, only the following levels are supported in this IDE.

            Microcode controls the CPU’s datapath; used to implement the
            fetch–execute cycle and define instruction behavior at the hardware
            control level.

            “Bare metal” mode without operating system support; teaches symbols

      <h2>Supported Architectures</h2>
      <p>
        This IDE is designed from the ground up to support Pep/10, which is the
        architecture introduced in the 6th edition of <i>Computer Systems</i>.
        Pep/10 is the recommended architecture for new projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        For backwards compatibility, both Pep/9 and Pep/8 remain available.
        These earlier architectures retain their original instruction sets and
        memory layouts, ensuring that existing course materials and example
        programs can still be used without modification. Pep/9 and Pep/8 are the
        architectures discussed in
        <i>Computer Systems</i> 5th and 4th editions, respectively.
      </p>
