# Textbook Examples
Pepp includes all program figures from the 4th, 5th, and 6th editions of *Computer Systems*.
These examples can be accessed from the **Help** mode and are organized by architecture and level of abstraction.

## Filtering Examples & Help
A filter at the top of the help topic tree view allows you to choose which examples to view based on:
* Architecture (e.g., Pep/10, Pep/9, Pep/8)
* Level of abstraction (e.g., ISA3, Asmb5)
This ensures you only see examples and coumentation compatible with your desired project type.

## Viewing Multiple Representations
Some figures have more than one representation of the same program—such as a machine language version and an equivalent assembly language version.
A drop-down menu above the code area lets you switch between these alternative views.

## Copying to a New Project
Use the **Copy to New Project** button below the figure to instantly create a new project containing the example’s source code.
This project will open in the appropriate [Editor]() mode for the chosen architecture and level.

The text next to the button provides a short description of the figure’s purpose, as given in the textbook.
