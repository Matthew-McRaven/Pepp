<h1>Hiding and Rearranging Panes</h1>
<p>
  In both the <a href="slug://editor">Editor</a> and <a href="slug://debugger">Debugger</a> modes, you can
  control which parts of the interface are visible and how they are arranged.
</p>

<h2>Showing and Hiding Panes</h2>
<p>
  A row of checkboxes at the bottom of the window lists all available panes for
  the current mode. Selecting a checkbox shows that pane; clearing it hides the
  pane. When you switch modes, the list updates to match the UI components
  available for that mode. For example, the memory dump is visible by default in
  Debugger mode but not in Editor mode.

</p>

<h2>Rearranging the Layout</h2>
<p>
  You can rearrange panes by clicking and dragging their title bars. This allows
  you to dock panes to different positions within the project workspace. Grey
  areas between panes are splitters, which can be dragged to resize panes.
</p>
<p>
  Layout changes apply per project and are saved until you adjust them again.

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Rearrangement limited to leftmost project</b>: Currently, UI
    rearrangement is only available for the leftmost project tab. Closing the
    leftmost project enables rearrangement in other tabs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Pane resizing on mode switch</b>: Switching between modes may cause pane
    sizes to shift gradually over time. These issues are known and being
    addressed in a future update.
  </li>
</ul>
