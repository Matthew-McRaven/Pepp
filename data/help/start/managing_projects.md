# Managing Projects
When working in the [Editor]() or [Debugger]() modes, open projects appear as tabs beneath the toolbar.
Each tab represents a separate project, with its own code, simulation state, and debugger context.

## Understanding the Tabs
* **Project Name** — If the project has been saved to a file, the file name is shown. Unsaved projects display a default name such as Unnamed 1. An asterisk (\*) and *italics* indicate unsaved changes.
* **Architecture and Level** — Shown below the project name, this identifies the project’s architecture (e.g., Pep/10) and level of abstraction (e.g., ISA3).
* **Close Button (X)** — Closes the project, prompting you to save if there are unsaved changes.
* **Plus Button (+)** — Creates a new project of the same architecture and level as the currently active project.

## Saving and Closing Projects
Closing the application prompts you to save all open projects with unsaved changes.
You can also save an individual project at any time using **File → Save** or **File → Save As**.

Multiple projects can remain open at once, allowing you to edit, simulate, and debug them independently.
