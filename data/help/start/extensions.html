<h1>File Extensions</h1>
<p>The Pepp system uses the following file extensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>.pep</code> — file extension for source code programs.</li>
  <li><code>.pepo</code> — file extension for object code programs.</li>
  <li>
    <code>.pepl</code> — file extension for the formatted program listing.
  </li>
  <li><code>.pepm</code> — file extension for macros.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  All these files are text files that you can modify with your favorite text
  editor or word processor outside the Pepp application. Although you can save a
  <code>.pepl</code> file, there is no facility for inputting it into the Pep/9
  application.
</p>
<p>
  When you open a file, it will open a dialog similar to the
  <b>Welcome</b> screen to select the appropriate project type for that file.
