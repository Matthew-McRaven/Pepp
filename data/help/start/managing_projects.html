<h1>Managing Projects</h1>
<p>
  When working in the <a href="#">Editor</a> or <a href="#">Debugger</a> modes,
  open projects appear as tabs beneath the toolbar. Each tab represents a
  separate project, with its own code, simulation state, and debugger context.
</p>

<h2>Understanding the Tabs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Project Name</b> — If the project has been saved to a file, the file name
    is shown. Unsaved projects display a default name such as Unnamed&nbsp;1. An
    asterisk (*) and <i>italics</i> indicate unsaved changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Architecture and Level</b> — Shown below the project name, this
    identifies the project’s architecture (e.g., Pep/10) and level of
    abstraction (e.g., ISA3).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Close Button (X)</b> — Closes the project, prompting you to save if there
    are unsaved changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Plus Button (+)</b> — Creates a new project of the same architecture and
    level as the currently active project.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Saving and Closing Projects</h2>
<p>
  Closing the application prompts you to save all open projects with unsaved
  changes. You can also save an individual project at any time using
  <b>File → Save</b> or <b>File → Save As</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Multiple projects can remain open at once, allowing you to edit, simulate, and
  debug them independently.
