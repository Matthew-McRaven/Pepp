<h1>Switching Modes</h1>
<p>
  Pep is a modal IDE, meaning the interface changes depending on the task you
  are performing. The mode selector appears as a vertical bar of icons on the
  left side of the window. The <b>Welcome</b> and <b>Help</b> modes are always
  visible, with additional modes available depending on the selected project.

</p>

<h2>Available Modes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Welcome</b> — Create a new project, open an existing one, or select
    examples from the help system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Help</b> — You are here. View the built-in help documentation, including
    examples that can be copied directly into a new project.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Editor</b> — Edit your project’s source or object code. This mode also
    includes tools for assembling and loading programs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Debugger</b> — Simulate, step through, and inspect the execution of code
    in your project.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Changing Modes</h2>
<p>
  Clicking an icon immediately switches to that mode, preserving the current
  state of the active project. For example, you can switch between
  <b>Editor</b> and <b>Debugger</b> without restarting or losing your position
  in the editor. Switching modes is <b>global</b>, meaning the selected mode
  will be used for all open projects.
</p>
<p>
  The set of available modes depends on the active project’s architecture and
  level of abstraction—some modes are not supported for all project types. For
  example, the microcode editor’s datapath view is not available at other levels
  of abstraction.
</p>
<p>
  Some actions—such as creating a new project from the Welcome
  screen—automatically switch you into the <b>Editor</b> mode.
