<h1>Textbook Examples</h1>
<p>
  Pep includes all program figures from the 4th, 5th, and 6th editions of
  <i>Computer Systems</i>. These examples can be accessed from the
  <b>Help</b> mode and are organized by architecture and level of abstraction.
</p>

<h2>Filtering Examples &amp; Help</h2>
<p>
  A filter at the top of the help topic tree view allows you to choose which
  examples to view based on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Architecture (e.g., Pep/10, Pep/9, Pep/8)</li>
  <li>Level of abstraction (e.g., ISA3, Asmb5)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This ensures you only see examples and documentation compatible with your
  desired project type.

<h2>Viewing Multiple Representations</h2>
<p>
  Some figures have more than one representation of the same program—such as a
  machine language version and an equivalent assembly language version. A
  drop-down menu above the code area lets you switch between these alternative
  views.

<h2>Copying to a New Project</h2>
<p>
  Use the <b>Copy to New Project</b> button below the figure to instantly create
  a new project containing the example’s source code. This project will open in
  the appropriate <a href="#">Editor</a> mode for the chosen architecture and
  level.
</p>
<p>
  The text next to the button provides a short description of the figure’s
  purpose, as given in the textbook.
