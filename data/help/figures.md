This section contains a list of programs from the text, Computer Systems, J. Stanley Warford, Fifth edition, Jones and Bartlett Learning, 2017. The list contains both machine language and assembly language programs from the listings in the figures from the text.

To test a program click the Copy to Object button (for machine language programs) or Copy to Source button (for assembly language programs), and the program will be copied to the corresponding pane in the application.

You can then run or trace the program in the application as usual.
