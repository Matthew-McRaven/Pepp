<h1>Object Code Editor</h1>
<p>
  The object code editor is a text editor for entering program bytes directly in
  hexadecimal format. It accepts only valid hexadecimal characters and the
  sentinel characters <code>z</code> and <code>Z</code>.
</p>

<p>
  In a feature new to Pep/10, both the sentiel and whitespace are optional. Both
  are automatically inserted when needed by the Pep/10 operating system. This
  improvement has been transparently backported to Pep/8 and Pep/9.
</p>

<p>
  It features an overwrite mode, which can be toggled via the
  <kbd>Insert</kbd> key. This allows you to replace existing bytes without
  shifting the surrounding content.
</p>
<p>
  As an editor, it is always read-only in <strong>Debugger</strong> mode.
  Outside of <strong>ISA3</strong>, it is also read-only because it is a
  generated output from assembling Pep/10 source programs.
