<h1>Byte Converters</h1>
<p>
  The byte converters are located in the toolbar and are available in all project
  types in both <strong>Editor</strong> and
  <strong>Debugger</strong> modes. They are text editors for
  entering a value as a decimal number, hexadecimal number, binary number, or
  ASCII character.
</p>

<p>
When data is entered in one of the
text editors, the other values are recalculated. For example, entering 97 in the decimal editor
will recalculate the value in hex and binary in the other text edits.
</p>

<p>
  There is also opcode converter, provided as a combo box with a drop-down menu.
  The opcode converter will update automatically to reflect the current
  instruction set architecture.
</p>
<p>
  This tool helps you translate between different bases and data formats, and is
  particularly helpful when writing ISA3 programs.
