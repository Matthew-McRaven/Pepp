<h1>CPU Dump</h1>
<p>
  The CPU dump displays the current state of the processor, including the NZVC
  status bits and all registers. The first column lists register names, the
  second column shows their hexadecimal values, and the third column shows a
  signed or unsigned integer representation. Right-clicking the third column
  lets you change its format to signed, unsigned, binary, or ASCII.
</p>

<p>
  For the instruction specifier, the value is shown in binary to aid opcode
  decoding, followed by its mnemonic.
</p>

<p>
  The values in the CPU pane are <i>after</i> the instruction in the
  instruction specifier has executed. In the von Neumann cycle, the program
  counter increments before the instruction executes, so the PC shows the
  address of the <i>next</i> instruction to execute.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>Note:</b> For <i>dyadic</i> instructions, the <b>Operand Specifier</b> and
  <b>(Operand)</b> rows are populated. The operand specifier is stored during
  instruction decoding. The operand itself is not part of the CPU
  stateâ€”except in the case of immediate addressing, where it <i>is</i> the
  operand specifier. For convenience, the CPU pane computes the operand from the
  addressing mode and displays it in parentheses to indicate that it is not an
  actual CPU register.
  <p>For <i>monadic</i> instructions, both rows remain blank.</p>
