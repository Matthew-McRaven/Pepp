<h1>Symbol Table</h1>
<p>
  The symbol table lists all symbols defined and used in your program, along
  with their associated values. It primarily appears in the
  <strong>Debugger</strong> mode of assembly projects, but may be made visible
  in the <strong>Editor</strong> using the <a href="slug://start/hide">visibility controls</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> In <b>OS4</b> projects, the table automatically switches between OS and user symbols depending on the current value of the program counter (PC).
</blockquote>

<h2>Selection</h2>
<p>
  You can click to select a single symbol, then shift-click to select a
  rectangular block. Your platform’s “select all” shortcut also works. If you
  use <strong>File → Copy</strong> or your platform’s copy shortcut, a text
  representation of the symbol table is copied to your clipboard.
