# Byte Converters

Any time the Pep/9 application is running, the byte converter is available in the tool bar.
The four input fields represent the value of a single byte as displayed from left to right in decimal, hexadecimal, binary, and ASCII.
Simply enter any value in any input field and the other fields will show the same value in the corresponding format.
Here is the result of entering the letter `P` in the ASCII field.

An instruction specifier decoder is to the right of the four input fields.
It displays the instruction mnemonic and possibly the addressing mode assuming you interpret the byte value as an instruction specifier.
