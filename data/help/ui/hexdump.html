      <h2>Anatomy of a Memory Row</h2>
      <p>Each row has three parts, separated by vertical bars:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Left:</b> The address (hex) of the first byte in the row.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Middle:</b> Eight cells, each representing a single byte in the row.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Right:</b> The ASCII rendering of the eight bytes, with
          non-printable characters shown as periods (<code>.</code>).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hover over any byte cell to see a tooltip with the decoded value in hex,
        unsigned decimal, binary, and the opcode interpretation.
      </p>

      <h2>Highlights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Red:</b> Bytes written since the last step. If a single step
          (including step over/out) executes multiple instructions, all bytes
          written during that step are highlighted.
        </li>
        <li><b>Orange:</b> The current value of <b>SP</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Blue:</b> The current value of <b>PC</b>.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <b>Note:</b> Exact colors may vary with the selected theme.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Navigation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the vertical scrollbar to move through memory.</li>
        <li>Enter an address in the "Scroll to" field at the bottom to jump directly to a specific memory address.</li>
        <li>
          Use the <b>SP</b> and <b>PC</b> buttons to jump to the current stack
          pointer and program counter, respectively.
        </li>
      </ul>
