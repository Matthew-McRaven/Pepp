<h1>Common Workflows</h1>

<p>
This section describes common workflows and actions in Pepp.
You should be familiar with the cited chapters from <i>Computer Systems</i>, and you should understand usage of the user interface.
You can read the earlier sections of this help for user interface guidance.

<h2>Cross-Cutting Topics</h2>
<p>
Several topics share common usage regardless of the type of development (e.g., Microcode versus
Assembly Language). This section provides details on each common topic.

<h2>Level-Specific Workflows</h2>
<p>
The workflows are different based on the level of abstraction. Higher levels
of abstraction (like ASMB5) build on lower levels of abstraction (like Microcode).
More programming tools exist at higher levels of abstraction (e.g., batch input/output)
than at lower levels of abstraction. The workflow is impacted by the availability of
these additional programming tools.
